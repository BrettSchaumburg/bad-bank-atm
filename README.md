 MIT Exercise to build a React App ATM with little security

I created the React App called Bad Bank due to not much for security features.  There is however a handy log in section to allow add different users.  
The functionality includeds a nav bar which will entail a single page application (SPA) in order to then add the appropriate page bodies.  They include, create user, login, deposit, withdrawal, balance, and all data.

The deposit page will only allow positive numbers and only takes numeric data.  It also will provide a success message once deposited.
The withdrawal page will only allow numbers as well but it also checks to see if you have enough money to make a withdrawal.  If you attempt to enter a number bigger than your balance it stops and gives you an "insufficient funds" message.  If you do have enough to make the withdrawal it will also give you a sucess message.
The balance page displays name and current balance.
The AllData page displays all transactions that the users has performed since logging in.

Thanks for checking this out!
